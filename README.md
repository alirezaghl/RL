In this repository, I share my codes while studying reinforcement learning and attempting to implement the majority of algorithms introduced in the Sutton and Barto textbook.

## Introduction
This repository contains implementations of various reinforcement learning algorithms, following the approaches described in the book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Sutton and Barto. The goal is to provide a comprehensive set of examples to help others understand and apply these concepts.

## Algorithms
### Dynamic Programming
- Policy Iteration
- Value Iteration

### Model-Free Methods
- Monte Carlo Methods
- Temporal-Difference Learning
  - SARSA
  - Q-Learning
- Actor-Critic Methods
  - A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic)

## Usage
Clone the repository and explore the notebooks to understand the implementation details. Each folder contains a set of Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations and code.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/alirezaghl/RL.git
cd RL
