# Analyzing Robustness of trained Networks with Different Seeds

## Overview
In this notebook, we investigate the robustness of untrained neural networks when initialized with different random seeds. 
The primary goal is to determine if the hidden activities of these networks remain separable under varying initial conditions.

## Methodology
We conducted experiments using four different random seeds to initialize the networks. The hidden activities of these untrained networks were then analyzed to assess their separability.

##Notebookes
This notebook contains the code for training neural networks on different tasks using various random seeds.
